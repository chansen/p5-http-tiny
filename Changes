    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    - The 'proxy' attribute no longer takes precedence over the
      'http_proxy' environment variable.  With the addition of http_proxy
      and https_proxy attributes (and corresponding environment variable
      defaults), the legacy 'proxy' attribute now maps to the
      all_proxy/ALL_PROXY environment variable and only takes effect when
      other proxy attributes are not defined.

    [ADDED]

    - Added support for Basic authorization with proxies

    - Added support for https proxies via CONNECT

    options to control SSL verification. (GH #6, #9) [Mike Doherty]
