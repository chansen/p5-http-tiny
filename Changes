0.080     2021-11-05 08:15:46-04:00 America/New_York

    - No changes from 0.079-TRIAL.

0.079     2021-11-04 12:33:43-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed uninitialized value warnings on older Perls when the REQUEST_METHOD
      environment variable is set and CGI_HTTP_PROXY is not.

0.078     2021-08-02 09:24:03-04:00 America/New_York

    - No changes from 0.077-TRIAL.

0.077     2021-07-22 13:07:14-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [ADDED]

    - Added a `patch` helper method for the HTTP `PATCH` verb.

    - If the REQUEST_METHOD environment variable is set, then CGI_HTTP_PROXY
      replaces HTTP_PROXY.

    [FIXED]

    - Unsupported scheme errors early without giving an uninitialized value
      warning first.

    - Sends Content-Length: 0 on empty body PUT/POST.  This is not in the spec,
      but some servers require this.

    - Allows optional status line reason, as clarified in RFC 7230.

    - Ignore SIGPIPE on reads as well as writes, as IO::Socket::SSL says that
      SSL reads can also send writes as a side effect.

    - Check if a server has closed a connection before preserving it for reuse.

    [DOCS]

    - Clarified that exceptions/errors result in 599 status codes.

    [PREREQS]

    - Optional IO::Socket::IP prereq must be at least version 0.32 to be used.
      This ensures correct timeout support.

      CRLF.

0.061     2016-08-05 12:10:19-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

      the list of directories in @INC by default.

0.058     2016-05-03 11:29:57-04:00 America/New_York

0.057     2016-04-18 10:17:00-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [ADDED]

    - Added support for the SSL_CERT_FILE environment variable.

    - Added 'peer' attribute to force a connection to a particular
      server.

    - Added 'connected' method to allow introspection of persistent
      connections.

    - An array reference of redirection result hash references is included
      in the final response hash reference (but only if redirects occur).

    [CHANGED]

    - Because folded headers are obsoleted in the revised RFCs, if CRLF is
      found in header values followed by one or more spaces, they are all
      replaced by a single space.

    [FIXED]

    - Per the RFC, control headers are now sent first before other headers
      (which are sent in arbitrary order).

    - Only well-known headers have their case canonicalized; all other
      headers are sent in the case provided by the user.

    - The 'keep_alive' option now also sets the SO_KEEPALIVE option
      on the underlying socket to help with long-lived, idle connections.

    - Request header field values are now validated against the RFC rules
      (i.e. empty or else space-or-tab separated tokens of printable
      characters).

0.056     2015-05-19 06:00:40-04:00 America/New_York

    - Added 'can_ssl' method to detect SSL support before trying and
      failing with a fatal exception.

    - Added support for 308 redirects

    [FIXED]

    - When specifying a custom CA file, if that file is missing or
      unreadable, HTTP::Tiny will no longer fall back to a default CA

    [DOCUMENTED]

    - Noted units are bytes for max_size

0.054     2015-01-27 07:18:19-05:00 America/New_York

0.048     2014-08-21 13:19:51-04:00 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Protected proxy tests from ALL_PROXY in the environment

0.047     2014-07-29 14:09:05-04:00 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - Updated Mozilla::CA module recommendation version to 20130114

    [FIXED]

0.046     2014-07-21 10:32:32-04:00 America/New_York

0.044     2014-07-16 23:46:09-04:00 America/New_York

    [CHANGED]

    - Providing a custom 'Host' header is now a fatal exception.  Previously, it
      was silently ignored, as the RFC mandates that Host be set from the
      URL, but ignoring it could lead to unexpected, confusing errors.

    - optimized URL splitting

    - Passing 'undef' for any proxy attribute will prevent HTTP::Tiny from
      setting the proxy from the environment.

0.043     2014-02-20 20:40:23-05:00 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Does not send absolute request URI when tunneling SSL via proxy

    - Fixes regression in setting host name to verify SSL

    - Protects tests from https_proxy and all_proxy when doing mock testing

    [ADDED]

    - If IO::Socket::IP 0.25+ is installed, HTTP::Tiny will use it for
      transparent IPv4 or IPv6 support.

0.041     2014-02-17 13:07:54-05:00 America/New_York

    [no code change, only an amended Changes file]

    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES (from 0.039)]

    - The 'proxy' attribute no longer takes precedence over the
      'http_proxy' environment variable.  With the addition of http_proxy
      and https_proxy attributes (and corresponding environment variable
      defaults), the legacy 'proxy' attribute now maps to the
      all_proxy/ALL_PROXY environment variable and only takes effect when
      other proxy attributes are not defined.

    [ADDED (since 0.039)]

    - Added 'keep_alive' attribute for single-server persistent connections
      (Clinton Gormley)

    - Added support for Basic authorization with proxies

    [FIXED (since 0.039)]

      Evans)

    if provided as a hash reference.)

  [ADDED]
